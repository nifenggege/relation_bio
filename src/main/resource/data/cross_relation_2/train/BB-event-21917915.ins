+1	Here, we show how one of the commonest and most significant PROT_2 pathogens, PROT_1, captures Hb as the first step of an iron-scavenging pathway. The x-ray crystal structure of Hb bound to a domain from the Isd (iron-regulated surface determinant) protein, IsdH, is the first structure of a Hb capture complex to be determined.
-1	In PROT_2, hemoglobin (Hb) represents the largest reservoir of iron, and pathogens express Hb-binding proteins to access this source. Here, we show how one of the commonest and most significant human pathogens, PROT_1, captures Hb as the first step of an iron-scavenging pathway.
+1	In mammals, hemoglobin (Hb) represents the largest reservoir of iron, and pathogens express Hb-binding proteins to access this source. Here, we show how one of the commonest and most significant PROT_2 pathogens, PROT_1, captures Hb as the first step of an iron-scavenging pathway.
