-1	A putative rolB gene homologue of the PROT_1 TR-DNA has different morphogenetic activity in PROT_2 than rolB.
-1	PROT_1 strains of the agropine type harbor on their Ri-plasmid two T-DNAs, a left TL-DNA and a right TR-DNA. The rolB gene of the TL-DNA is the major factor in the pathogenesis of the PROT_2 disease and its constitutive expression interfere profoundly with plant morphogenesis.
