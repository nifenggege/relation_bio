+1	PROT_1 cells grown on fructose by decreasing DPH fluorescence polarization. In contrast, the membrane of cells grown on biphenyl showed a considerably less significant effect of TeCB on membrane polarization than in fructose-grown cells. An increase in the ratio of total saturated to unsaturated fatty acids in cells grown on biphenyl suggested less of a fluidizing effect of TeCB on membranes in those cells. When biphenyl-grown cells were transferred back to a PROT_2
-1	PROT_1 were investigated by measuring fluorescence polarization using 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) as the probe, and determining the cellular fatty acid compositions. TeCB significantly affected the membrane of R. eutropha H850 cells grown on fructose by decreasing DPH fluorescence polarization. In contrast, the membrane of cells grown on biphenyl showed a considerably less significant effect of TeCB on membrane polarization than in fructose-grown cells. An increase in the ratio of total saturated to unsaturated fatty acids in cells grown on biphenyl suggested less of a fluidizing effect of TeCB on membranes in those cells.

-1	PROT_1. The effects of 2,2',5,5'-tetrachlorobiphenyl (TeCB), a PCB congener, and biphenyl on the cytoplasmic membranes of Ralstonia eutropha H850 were investigated by measuring fluorescence polarization using 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) as the probe, and determining the cellular fatty acid compositions. TeCB significantly affected the membrane of R. eutropha H850 cells grown on fructose by decreasing DPH fluorescence polarization.
