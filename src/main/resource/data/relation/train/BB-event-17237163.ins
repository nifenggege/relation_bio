+1	PROT_1 is an opportunistic pathogen and a major cause of PROT_2 infections.
+1	In previous studies of PROT_1, we showed that PROT_2 maturation and sloughing were regulated by N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL)-based quorum sensing (QS).
+1	We concluded that PROT_1 utilizes different regulatory systems and adhesins in attachment to PROT_2 and that QS is a main regulatory pathway in adhesion to an abiotic surface but not in adhesion to a biotic surface.
+1	We concluded that PROT_1 utilizes different regulatory systems and adhesins in attachment to biotic and PROT_2 and that QS is a main regulatory pathway in adhesion to an abiotic surface but not in adhesion to a biotic surface.
