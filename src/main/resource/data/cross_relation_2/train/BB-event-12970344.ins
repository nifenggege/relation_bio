+1	To cleave the beta-1,4-linkages between beta-d-galactose and alpha-l-3,6-anhydro-galactose residues in the red algal galactans known as agars, PROT_2 bacteria produce polysaccharide hydrolases called beta-agarases. Beta-agarases A and B from PROT_1 have recently been biochemically characterized.
