-1	Flomoxef (FMOX) has a broad antibacterial spectrum against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria; especially its potent antibacterial activity against PROT_1 is a significant advantage that may not be found with other cephem compounds. In our determination of its antibacterial potency against various PROT_2 isolates obtained from clinical materials (amniotic fluid, intrauterine secretions, exudates of the pelvic dead space) of patients with various infections, we obtained results representing specific features of this drug.
