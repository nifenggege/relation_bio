-1	Several pathogenic strains of PROT_1 exploit type III secretion to inject "effector proteins" into PROT_2, which then subvert eukaryotic cell biology to the bacterium's advantage.

-1	PROT_1 also harbors functional homologs of effectors from PROT_2 pathogens (HopPtoH, HopW, AvrA) and from Shigella (OspD, OspE, OspG), and two additional members of the Map/IpgB family.
