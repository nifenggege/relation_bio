-1	Antibacterial properties of dermaseptin S4 derivatives under extreme incubation conditions. Antibacterial properties of the PROT_2-derived peptide dermaseptin S4 and a series of synthetic derivatives against the food pathogen PROT_1 were investigated under extreme incubation conditions.
+1	Antibacterial properties of the frog-derived peptide dermaseptin S4 and a series of synthetic derivatives against the PROT_2 pathogen PROT_1 were investigated under extreme incubation conditions. The 28-mer analog K4K20S4 (P28) displayed an MIC of 8 microM and rapid bactericidal kinetics under standard culture conditions.
