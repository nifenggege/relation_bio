+1	As proof of principle, successful combination with a luminescence-based assay in HTS format was demonstrated. Here, both intracellular growth of PROT_1 (luminescence) and PROT_2 viability (SYTOX Green exclusion) were assayed in the same screening well.

Incorporation of membrane-impermeant, DNA-binding, fluorescent dyes in HTS assays should prove useful by allowing evaluation of cytotoxicity in real time, eliminating reagent addition steps and effort associated with endpoint cell viability analysis, and reducing the need for follow-up cytotoxicity screening.
