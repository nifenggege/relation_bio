-1	MBP-pepsinogen, however, was efficiently renatured from 8 M urea in vitro, suggesting that the PROT_1 cytoplasm does not support folding of the PROT_2 partner protein to the native state.
-1	Order of fusions between bacterial and PROT_2 proteins can determine solubility in PROT_1.
-1	We made fusions between PROT_1 maltose-binding protein (MBP) and the PROT_2 aspartic proteinases pepsinogen or procathepsin D.
