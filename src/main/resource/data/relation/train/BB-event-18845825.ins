+1	High genetic diversity of nontypeable PROT_1 isolates from two PROT_2.
-1	High genetic diversity of nontypeable PROT_1 isolates from two children attending a PROT_2.
+1	Twenty-one PROT_1 isolates from the PROT_2 were genotyped by multilocus sequence typing.
-1	Twenty-one PROT_1 isolates from the throats of two PROT_2 were genotyped by multilocus sequence typing.
-1	These STs were scattered throughout the phylogenetic tree of reported PROT_1 STs, demonstrating the high level of NTHi diversity found in PROT_2.
