-1	PROT_2-derived peptide dermaseptin S4 and a series of synthetic derivatives against the food pathogen PROT_1
+1	PROT_2 pathogen PROT_1
-1	PROT_1 were investigated under extreme incubation conditions. The 28-mer analog K4K20S4 (P28) displayed an MIC of 8 microM and rapid bactericidal kinetics under standard culture conditions. Potent bactericidal properties were maintained at PROT_2
-1	PROT_1 were investigated under extreme incubation conditions. The 28-mer analog K4K20S4 (P28) displayed an MIC of 8 microM and rapid bactericidal kinetics under standard culture conditions. Potent bactericidal properties were maintained at high salt concentrations, under acidic or basic conditions, and at extreme temperatures. The N-terminal 14-mer sequence (P14) displayed higher potency (MIC, 4 microM) but only within a narrow range of incubation conditions, pointing to the importance of the C-terminal domain of P28. The potency range was reextended upon conjugation of aminododecanoic acid to P14. The resulting lipopeptide was even more potent (MIC, 2 microM) and affected bacterial viability under most of the conditions tested, including in PROT_2
