-1	Full-length HOX polypeptide was produced in PROT_1, but no HOX activity could be detected. In contrast, active HOX could be produced in the PROT_2.
-1	Hexose oxidase (D-hexose:O(2)-oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.3.5, HOX) normally found in the PROT_2 was produced heterologously in different host systems. Full-length HOX polypeptide was produced in PROT_1, but no HOX activity could be detected.
