-1	Previously, it has been shown that the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or free lipid A of PROT_1 can trigger morphological changes in the PROT_2's light organ that occur upon colonization.

+1	Given their unusual nature, it is possible that these features of the PROT_1 lipid A may underlie the ability of PROT_2 to recognize its symbiotic partner.
